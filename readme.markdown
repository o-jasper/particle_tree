# Electron-positron-photon shower

This will be an approximation, using only Brehmstrahlung and pair production.
Not entirely sure where exactly the approximation starts.

Currently it is probably pretty much wrong due to the soft photon spectrum
not being correct. Nevertheless it does seem like for instance the muon does
radiate less and loses less energy.(though i think it isn't 'less enough')

The scale of spatial sizes is not quite right yet either.

## TODO

* soft photon spectrum thing..

* get spatial scales right

* simple opengl drawer.

* histogram stuff.
