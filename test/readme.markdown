# Tested

* bijection: lorentz-transform.

* 'transporting' and drawing it. The plan it have it also run 
  `check_kinematic_consistency`
   + but currently it doesn't succeed yet! get smallish differences from
	 ignoring the soft photon.. (maybe the soft photon should be an object..)

# Still to test

* conservation correctness(or rather how far the rounding deviates)
  + energy&momentum
  + 'average energy position in CM frame'(it is conserved!)

* probability distributions
